I performed time-frequency decomposition of data from a single channel, 'Cz' using an adapted Mike Cohen script.
The adapted version is nice because it deals with sharp edges during trial concatenation using 'reflection'.
I also updated the function that I used to perform a transformation of complex numbers to real numbers, 
a nice tweak that decreases file size and computation time dramatically.
