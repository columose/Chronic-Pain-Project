# Chronic-Pain-Project

The purpose of this repository is to share pre-processing and data analysis scripts with other researchers. Our study examined predictive coding differences between chronic pain patients and healthy controls. We performed time-domain, time-frequency and source localisation analyses on EEG signals which were collected during an auditory oddball paradigm.

If you have any questions about the scripts, please feel free to contact colum.ose28@gmail.com. I'll do my best to get back to you quickly if you enter something along the lines of 'github script queries' in the subject.
