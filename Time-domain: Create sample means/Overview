Credit goes out to my friend and colleague Feifan Chen for this!

With conditioning experiments, conditions may be presented with highly uneven ratios, to prime participants to predict
the sensation of a given condition. The downside of this is that comparing average ERPs of conditions with a highly uneven
trial count is tricky. The condition with more trials will have less variance in the average ERP.

To correct for this, we created a distribution of sample means, and then used the mean of this distribution as the average 
ERP for each participant. 

For example...
Condition 1 has 200 trials and condition 2 has 50 trials.

Select 50 trials randomly from condition 1, to match the trial count of condition 2. Average these trials to create an 
average ERP. Repeat this procedure 1,000 times to create a distribution of these permuted means. Then we take the average 
of the distribution to compare with condition 2.
